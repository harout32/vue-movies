## Notes

* pre-commit hooks should run and check your code coverage and linting issue to ensure quality , please turn on your ESLint Plugin and autoformat on save on your IDE for more seamless development experience.

* pre-commit hooks are equivalent to running
  1. `yarn lint:fix`
  2. `yarn test`
* unit test code coverage config is set in `jest.config.js` make sure to keep a good coverage and not hit the limit

* use coverage report as a compass while writing unit tests, run `yarn test:coverage` and the coverage report will be generated inside `<application-root>/coverage`

* style variables are defined in `tailwind.config.js` thus always use variables instead of custom colors EX: `bg-primary-100`.
